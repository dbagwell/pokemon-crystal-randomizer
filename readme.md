### Generating ROM's

1. Launch the Pokemon Crystal Randomizer Application.
1. Select a preset and or customize the changes you would like to make.
1. Click "Player Options" and customize your individual player options.
1. Click "GENERATE".
1. Provide a base "vanilla" ROM of Pokémon Crystal Version 1.1.

### Sharing Games

***Do NOT share the ROM files generated by this application.***

If you have a friend who would like to play the game using the exact same changes as you, before Generating your ROM, make sure the "Generate Patch File" option is checked. This will create a Pokemon Crystal Randomizer Patch (.pcrp) file that can be shared with others. 

Anyone with the randomizer application installed and a valid "vanilla" ROM of Pokémon Crystal Version 1.1 can use this patch file to generate their own ROM with the same changes (other than the individual player options). 

To do this, all they need to do is double-click on the patch file (Windows and macOS only), manually open the patch with the Pokemon Crystal Randomizer Application, or launch the application and select the patch file using the "Apply Patch" option from the "File" menu.

### Sharing Settings

Custom settings can also be exported as YAML files that can be imported by others and used to generate their own games with different seeds.

### About Player Options

The Player Options are a group of settings that can be customized individually by each player using a patch (.pcrp) file to generate a game with the same seed and settings. These settings are for things that can or would normally be customized by players in the game anyways (like their player name or their text speed).
